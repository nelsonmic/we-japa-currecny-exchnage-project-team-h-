# Currency Exchange app

## This is a currency exchange app that converts from one currency to another. This is essentially made for everyone that has to work on currency exchange rate accross the world

## Assumptions made

 we made research on how to execute the project and we thought it would be better to use an API since we did not want to hardcode. After consuming the API, the base currency was in Euro and this means we have to first convert to euro before converting to the destination currency.

`(AmountToConvert / AmountToConvertRate)*destinationCurrencyRate`
